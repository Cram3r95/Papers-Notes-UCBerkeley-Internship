# Papers-Notes:

This repository contains my tasks summary at the end of each day, paper (Pa) and posts (Po) reading notes on deep learning and machine learning, as well as tutorials covered, mainly focused on my thesis "Deep Learning based Multi-Object Tracking and Motion Prediction for Intelligent Vehicles applications" during my internship at UCBerkeley (April - July 2022).

# Notes: 

### April 
1st: 
<ul>
<li><p> First contact with the MSC lab. 
<li><p> Interview with the advisor (Wei Zhan) and PostDoc student (Chen Tang) to define my tasks. 
<li><p> Start to sort my UCBerkeley documents.
</ul>
4th: 
<ul>
<li><p> Finish to sort my UCBerkeley documents.  
<li><p> Start to study the NYU Deep Learning course -> Week 1 (50:33 YT video).
<li><p> Start to study the UPenn GNNs course (Introduction covered)   
<li><p> Join to MSC_Auto Slack and get papers to read about the new project: Explainable AI to study behavior prediction models 
</ul>
5th: 
<ul>
<li><p> Almost all paperwork is done.
<li><p> Read Project "Explainable AI for behaviour-prediction models".
<li><p> Finish to watch the first lecture (NYU-DL): "History, motivation, and evolution of Deep Learning". What's left: Highlight the theory of 1.1. and 1.2.
<li><p> See Lecture 1.1. "Graph Neural Networks" (UPenn-GNNs).
<li><p> Install LaneGCN and start reading its paper.
</ul>
6th: 
<ul>
<li><p> See Practicum 1 (NYU-Dl). What's left: Highlighy Lecture 1 and Practicum 1 theory, and run practicum 1 code.
<li><p> See Lecture 1.2. "Machine Learning on Graphs: The Why" (UPenn-GNNs).
<li><p> See Video 1 (Essence of Linear Algebra) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
<li><p> Start reading "YOU MOSTLY WALK ALONE: ANALYZING FEATURE ATTRIBUTION IN TRAJECTORY PREDICTION" paper.
</ul>
