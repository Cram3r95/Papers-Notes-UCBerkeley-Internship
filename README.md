# Papers-Notes

This repository contains my tasks summary at the end of each day, paper (Pa) and posts (Po) reading notes on deep learning and machine learning, as well as tutorials covered, mainly focused on my thesis "Deep Learning based Multi-Object Tracking and Motion Prediction for Intelligent Vehicles applications" during my internship at UCBerkeley (April - July 2022).

### April 
1st: 
<ul>
<li><p> First contact with the MSC lab.

<li><p> Start to sort my UCBerkeley documents.
</ul>
4th: 
<ul>
<li><p> Finish to sort my UCBerkeley documents.  
<li><p> Start to study the NYU Deep Learning course -> Week 1 (50:33 YT video).
<li><p> Start to study the UPenn GNNs course (Introduction covered)   
<li><p> Join to MSC_Auto Slack and get papers to read about the new project: Explainable AI to study behavior prediction models
